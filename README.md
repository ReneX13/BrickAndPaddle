# BrickAndPaddle
Simple Bricks and Paddle

Keys,
  -A to move left
  -D to move right
  -W to launch ball
  -S to shoot
  
Red Drops give you the ability to shoot and pic up your bullet capacity by 1.
  -Bullet Capacity is the amount of shots you can shot at a time.
Blue Drops yield an extra continue.
Green Drop increases paddle Speed.

The ball gets faster and faster each stage, so pick up as many green drops as you can. But be careful,
sometimes you'll need to sacrafice a continue for a green drop. Else, the ball might be too fast the next stage...
Act wisely. 

Art and Music not by me! I'll update sprites and music in the future.
